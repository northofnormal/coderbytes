My solutions to coderbyte challenges

Two beefs with Coderbyte thus far, one small, one large. 

Small: quit assuming I'm dude. I'm not. Amazingly, slightly over half of the world's population is not. 
Some of these people may want to use Coderbyte to test their skills, and some of them may be sick of 
the constant assumption that the only people at all interested in coding are dudes. 

Large: stop assuming I have a math degree. I don't. In fact, I'm betting a lot of people who use Coderbyte 
are not coming from a traditional university-granted CS-degree background. If you think finding the mean and the 
mode are "easy" skills, define "mean" and "mode" for me. Don't make me wait until I open the problem, starting the 
timer, to realize that you aren't defining your terms, and I'm going to have to use some of the time that contributes
to my score googling "wtf is the mode"? 

Overall, it's been an awesome tool and I've had a lot of fun using it.
